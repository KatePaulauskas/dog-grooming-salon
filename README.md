### Project Link

Live site can be found at the following [address](https://barks-in-bubbles-a17d3839532d.herokuapp.com/).


## Agile Methodology

This project was developed using the Agile methodology, which allows for iterative development and flexibility. The Agile methodology was utilised to plan and track the progress of the project. Agile principles were applied throughout the project through the use of the following tools and principles:

**Planning and Tracking:** 

All user stories were managed through GitHub Issues and Projects, ensuring a structured and organised workflow.

**Custom Templates:**

Issues were created for each user story using custom templates, including sections such as user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks. This standardised the information captured for each story, making it easier to manage and track their progress.

**MoSCoW Method:**

To prioritise tasks, the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have) was implemented usign labels. This can be viewed [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/dog-grooming-salon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). This method helped in labelling the importance of each user story, ensuring that critical features were developed first within an iteration, while less critical features could be developed towards the end of the iteration or scheduled for later, if needed.

**Kanban Board:** 

A Kanban board on GitHub Projects was employed to manage user stories. The board was divided into three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done, allowing for clear visibility of the project's status at any given time. This can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/KatePaulauskas/projects/2).

**Milestones and Iterations:**

Milestones were used to define the project’s iterations. Each user story was categorised within one of five iterations, facilitating a structured development process and ensuring that work progresses in an organised manner. Project Milestones can be seen [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/dog-grooming-salon/milestones).

By leveraging these Agile practices and tools, the project maintained a clear and organised structure, allowing for effective tracking and timely completion of all 17 user stories.

## User Experience Design 

The Barks in Bubbles website was crafted using the Five Planes of Web Design approach. This methodology addresses each aspect of the design process, from strategy and scope to structure, skeleton, and surface, creating a positive user experience. By following this structured approach, it was possible to align user needs with business goals, resulting in an inviting, informative, and efficient online platform for pet owners in the Cork area.

### Surface
At the Surface Plane the visual design of the site was developed, where more focus was given to the look and feel of the site.

#### Color Scheme

The colors for the Barks in Bubbles site were carefully selected using [Coolors tool](https://coolors.co/) to create an inviting, professional, and engaging atmosphere. 

![Color Scheme](media/barks-in-bubbles-color-pallet.png)

The chosen color palette, set against a white background, combines freshness, warmth, tranquility, playfulness, and sophistication to create a balanced and appealing environment. Each color plays a specific role in enhancing the customer experience:

- Mantis provides a calming and natural feel.

- UT Orange injects energy and warmth.

- Robin Egg Blue offers tranquility and trustworthiness.

- Hot Pink adds fun and liveliness.

- English Violet lends an air of sophistication and quality.

- The white background ensures that these colors stand out beautifully, contributing to an inviting, professional, and engaging atmosphere that appeals to both pets and their owners. 

Below is a detailed breakdown of the color choices and the reasoning behind them:

**Mantis (#5ecc5c):**

Mantis is a vibrant green color that exudes a sense of freshness and vitality. This color was chosen to evoke feelings of nature, growth, and renewal, which are associated with health and well-being. It represents the care and rejuvenation that pets will experience at the grooming salon. Green is also known for its calming effects, making it a good choice for both pets and their owners.

**UT Orange (#fe8b32):**

UT Orange is a bright, warm orange color that captures attention and adds a touch of energy. Orange is often associated with enthusiasm, creativity, and warmth. This color was selected to create a welcoming and energetic atmosphere in the salon. It can help to make the environment feel friendly and inviting, encouraging customers to feel excited about bringing their pets for grooming services.

**Robin Egg Blue (#14cfdb):**

Robin Egg Blue is a light and refreshing blue color reminiscent of clear skies and calm waters. This color was chosen to convey tranquility, trust, and reliability. Blue is known to have a soothing effect, which is beneficial in a setting where pets may be anxious. It also gives a sense of cleanliness and professionalism, reassuring clients of the high standards of hygiene and care in the salon.

**Hot Pink (#ff5cb7):**

Hot Pink is a bold and playful pink color that adds a fun and energetic vibe. Pink is often associated with compassion, nurturing, and love. The vibrant shade of hot pink was chosen to inject a sense of playfulness and joy into the salon's environment. It reflects the affectionate and caring nature of the services provided, making the space feel lively and engaging.

**English Violet (#3f3850):**

English Violet is a deep, rich violet color that adds depth and sophistication. Violet is traditionally associated with luxury, wisdom, and dignity. This color was chosen to convey a sense of premium quality and elegance. It adds a touch of sophistication to the salon's aesthetic, appealing to clients who value high-quality services and a refined atmosphere.

**White Background (#ffffff):**

The primary background color used throughout the design is white. White is the perfect canvas for highlighting the vibrant and diverse color palette. It provides a clean, crisp, and professional look that enhances readability and ensures that the bright colors stand out without overwhelming the viewer. White backgrounds help create a sense of openness and space, making the salon feel more inviting and less cluttered. It also reinforces the notions of cleanliness and simplicity, which are essential qualities for a grooming salon. 

The combination of these colors ensures that the salon not only stands out visually but also conveys the values and quality of the services provided.

#### Typography

The fonts for the site were carefully selected using font pairing service [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/) to create a visually appealing and cohesive design. Each font was chosen to enhance the user experience and align with the brand's identity. 

![Typography Font Paring](/media/typography-font-paring.jpeg)

**Headings (H1)**

The "Righteous" font was chosen for the main headings (H1) to make a bold and memorable first impression. This sans-serif font is playful and modern, reflecting the friendly and approachable nature of Barks in Bubbles. Its distinct style helps to draw attention to the main titles, ensuring that they stand out prominently on the page.

**Subheadings (H2-H4)**

For subheadings (H2-H4), "Cormorant Upright" was selected to provide a sophisticated and elegant look. This font adds a touch of class and refinement to the website, aligning with the high-quality grooming services offered by the salon. The larger font size ensures that these subheadings are easily readable and effectively break up the content into manageable sections.

**Smaller Headings (H5-H6)**

The "Cormorant Upright" font is also used for smaller headings (H5-H6) to maintain consistency across all heading levels. By using the same font family, the website achieves a harmonious and unified look. The smaller size still ensures readability while keeping the overall design cohesive.

**Paragraphs**

For the body text, "Khula" was chosen for its clean and modern appearance. This sans-serif font is easy to read, making it ideal for longer passages of text. The slightly larger font size enhances readability, ensuring that users can comfortably read the content. The font's simplicity complements the more decorative heading fonts, creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing design.

The combination of "Righteous" for main headings, "Cormorant Upright" for subheadings and smaller headings, and "Khula" for paragraphs creates a well-rounded and visually engaging typography approach for the Barks in Bubbles website. Each font was carefully selected to reflect the brand's personality, enhance readability, and ensure a cohesive user experience. The consistent use of the English Violet color (#3f3850) ties all the text elements together, reinforcing the site's elegant and professional appearance.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

The application encountered two main issues when attempting to get a responsive mockup on [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive):


**1. Mixed Content Errors:**

```
Mixed Content: The page at '<URL>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure element '<URL>'. This request was automatically upgraded to HTTPS
```

**2. X-Frame-Options Deny:**

```
Refused to display 'https://barks-in-bubbles-a17d3839532d.herokuapp.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'
```

The application could not be displayed in a frame because of the X-Frame-Options header set to 'deny'. This security measure prevents the site from being embedded in an iframe, causing issues for certain use cases where framing the site is necessary.

![Responsive Design Error](/media/responsive-design-error.jpeg)

***SOLUTIONS***

**1. Mixed Content Errors:**
Configured Cloudinary to ensure that all URLs are generated with HTTPS by setting the secure parameter to True in the Cloudinary configuration using instructions from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48508750/how-to-force-https-in-a-django-project-using-cloudinary).

```python
import cloudinary 
import cloudinary.uploader 
import cloudinary.api

# Ensures URLs are generated with HTTPS
cloudinary.config(
    secure=True
)
```
Updated the `base.html` template to ensure it uses the Cloudinary template tag:

```
{% load cloudinary %}
```

**2. Modified X-Frame-Options Header:**

Changed the X_FRAME_OPTIONS setting in Django to allow framing from the project  domain using instructions from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options):

```python
# Set the X-Frame-Options header value
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'ALLOW-FROM https://barks-in-bubbles-a17d3839532d.herokuapp.com/'

```

### Remaining Bugs

In step two of the booking process, during the initial booking, users must choose a groomer to go back to the previous step. If a groomer is not selected, a notification stating 'Please select an item in the list' appears. The same issue occurs during the editing of an appointment. If the previously selected groomer is unavailable on the selected date, the groomer dropdown is blank. To proceed back to step one, the user must select a groomer. Although this is part of the validation process, it does not provide the best user experience. This bug remains unresolved due to time constraint.

![Bug - Step Two Booking process](/media/bug-step-two-booking-form.jpeg)

## Deployment

The Dog Grooming Salon 'Barks in Bubbles' website is hosted on Heroku, a container-based cloud platform designed for app development, deployment, and management. It was deployed following the steps below.

### Part 1: Create a New App

1. **Log into Heroku Account**

2. **Create a New App:**
   - Select 'New' in the top-right corner of the Heroku Dashboard.
   - Choose 'Create new app' from the dropdown menu.
   - Enter the app name 'barks-in-bubbles' and select Europe as the region.
   - Click 'Create App'.

3. **Access Settings and Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Go to the 'Settings' tab of the created app.
   - Click on 'Config Vars'.
   - Add the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` key with a value of `1`.
   - Click 'Add'.
   - Add the `CLOUDINARY_URL` key with a value in the following format: `cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>`.
   - Click 'Add'.
   - Add the `DATABASE_URL` key with a value in the following format: `postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>`.
   - Click 'Add'.

### Part 2 - Update Code for Deployment

1. **Prepare Dependencies:**
   - In the workspace terminal, run the command to create a `requirements.txt` file with the project's dependencies for each project dependency, while working on the project:
     ```
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Install Gunicorn:**
   - Install the web server Gunicorn:
     ```
     pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
     ```
   - Add Gunicorn to the project requirements:
     ```
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Create a Procfile:**
   - Create a `Procfile` at the root directory of the project.
   - Declare the process as `web` and add a start command:
     ```
     web: gunicorn codestar.wsgi
     ```

4. **Update Project settings.py File:**
   - Change `DEBUG` to `False`:
     ```
     DEBUG = False
     ```
   - Add `'.herokuapp.com'` to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the project settings:
     ```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
         '8000-katepaulaus-doggrooming-98d5mf21glf.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net',
         '.herokuapp.com'
     ]
     ```

5. **Push Updated Code to GitHub**

### Part 3 - Deployment with Static Files

To ensure the deployed app looks as nicely styled as the local development version, the project was deployed with static files using the WhiteNoise Python package by following the steps below:

1. **Install and Set Up the Python Package:**
   - Install WhiteNoise:
     ```
     pip3 install whitenoise~=5.3.0
     ```
   - Add WhiteNoise to the project requirements:
     ```
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```
   - Integrate WhiteNoise into Django's `MIDDLEWARE` in the `groomingsalon/settings.py` file, ensuring it is placed right after the Django `SecurityMiddleware`:
     ```
     MIDDLEWARE = [
         'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
         'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
         # Other middleware...
     ]
     ```

2. **Create a Static Files Directory and Collect Static Files:**
   - Set the `STATIC_ROOT` path in the `groomingsalon/settings.py` file:
     ```
     STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
     ```
   - Run the `collectstatic` command in the terminal to gather static files into the `staticfiles` directory:
     ```
     python3 manage.py collectstatic
     ```

3. **Deployment:**
   - Check the Python version by running:
     ```
     python3 -V
     ```
   - From the [supported runtimes](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#specifying-a-python-version), copy the runtime closest to the current Python version.
   - Add a `runtime.txt` file to the project's root directory with the copied Python version: `python-3.12.4`.
   - Set `DEBUG` to `False` and push the changes to GitHub.
   - Open the Heroku dashboard, go to the app 'Settings' tab, and under 'Reveal config vars', remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` key/value pair.

### Part 4 - Set Up Deployment from GitHub

1. **Set Up Deployment from GitHub:**
   - In the Heroku dashboard switch to the 'Deploy' tab.
   - Choose 'GitHub' as the deployment method and connect the GitHub account.
   - In the search bar, type the repository name `dog-grooming-salon` and click 'Search' to find it on GitHub.
   - Click 'Connect' to link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

2. **Deploy the App:**
   - Click 'Deploy Branch' to manually deploy the app.
   - Wait for the app to build. Once ready, the message “Your app was successfully deployed” appears.

3. **View Deployed App:**
   - Click on the 'View' button to see the deployed project.

The deployed project link can be found at the following URL: [Dog Grooming Salon: Barks in Bubbles](https://barks-in-bubbles-a17d3839532d.herokuapp.com/).

### Code Development

- To center the logo position in the header, the transform on the logo in the header was used: [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/121718-how-to-use-transform-translate-50-50-to-center-an-element-in-css121718-how-to-use-transform-translate-50-50-to-center-an-element-in-css).
- Visited state for the buttons in the header was set using instructions from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited).
- Buttons' background after the visited state was set following instructions from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28471219/issue-with-background-color-of-a-button-after-visited-state).
- Redirect to the Appointment booking page after a user is logged in was set using instructions from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/django-redirects/).
- The `get_context_data` method was used to include multiple models' data in a Django class-based view for the home page following instructions from [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/#adding-extra-context).
