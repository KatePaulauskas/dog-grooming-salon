## Agile Methodology

This project was developed using the Agile methodology, which allows for iterative development and flexibility. The Agile methodology was utilised to plan and track the progress of the project. Agile principles were applied throughout the project through the use of the following tools and principles:

**Planning and Tracking:** 

All user stories were managed through GitHub Issues and Projects, ensuring a structured and organised workflow.

**Custom Templates:**

Issues were created for each user story using custom templates, including sections such as user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks. This standardised the information captured for each story, making it easier to manage and track their progress.

**MoSCoW Method:**

To prioritise tasks, the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have) was implemented usign labels. This can be viewed [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/dog-grooming-salon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). This method helped in labelling the importance of each user story, ensuring that critical features were developed first within an iteration, while less critical features could be developed towards the end of the iteration or scheduled for later, if needed.

**Kanban Board:** 

A Kanban board on GitHub Projects was employed to manage user stories. The board was divided into three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done, allowing for clear visibility of the project's status at any given time. This can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/KatePaulauskas/projects/2).

**Milestones and Iterations:**

Milestones were used to define the project’s iterations. Each user story was categorised within one of five iterations, facilitating a structured development process and ensuring that work progresses in an organised manner. Project Milestones can be seen [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/dog-grooming-salon/milestones).

By leveraging these Agile practices and tools, the project maintained a clear and organised structure, allowing for effective tracking and timely completion of all 17 user stories.

   - Choose 'Create new app' from the dropdown menu.
   - Enter the app name 'barks-in-bubbles' and select Europe as the region.
   - Click 'Create App'.

3. **Access Settings and Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Go to the 'Settings' tab of the created app.
   - Click on 'Config Vars'.
   - Add the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` key with a value of `1`.
   - Click 'Add'.
   - Add the `CLOUDINARY_URL` key with a value in the following format: `cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>`.
   - Click 'Add'.
   - Add the `DATABASE_URL` key with a value in the following format: `postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>`.
   - Click 'Add'.

### Part 2 - Update Code for Deployment

1. **Prepare Dependencies:**
   - In the workspace terminal, run the command to create a `requirements.txt` file with the project's dependencies for each project dependency, while working on the project:
     ```
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Install Gunicorn:**
   - Install the web server Gunicorn:
     ```
     pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
     ```
   - Add Gunicorn to the project requirements:
     ```
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Create a Procfile:**
   - Create a `Procfile` at the root directory of the project.
   - Declare the process as `web` and add a start command:
     ```
     web: gunicorn codestar.wsgi
     ```

4. **Update Project settings.py File:**
   - Change `DEBUG` to `False`:
     ```
     DEBUG = False
     ```
   - Add `'.herokuapp.com'` to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the project settings:
     ```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
         '8000-katepaulaus-doggrooming-98d5mf21glf.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net',
         '.herokuapp.com'
     ]
     ```

5. **Push Updated Code to GitHub**

### Part 3 - Deployment with Static Files

To ensure the deployed app looks as nicely styled as the local development version, the project was deployed with static files using the WhiteNoise Python package by following the steps below:

1. **Install and Set Up the Python Package:**
   - Install WhiteNoise:
     ```
     pip3 install whitenoise~=5.3.0
     ```
   - Add WhiteNoise to the project requirements:
     ```
     pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
     ```
   - Integrate WhiteNoise into Django's `MIDDLEWARE` in the `groomingsalon/settings.py` file, ensuring it is placed right after the Django `SecurityMiddleware`:
     ```
     MIDDLEWARE = [
         'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
         'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
         # Other middleware...
     ]
     ```

2. **Create a Static Files Directory and Collect Static Files:**
   - Set the `STATIC_ROOT` path in the `groomingsalon/settings.py` file:
     ```
     STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
     ```
   - Run the `collectstatic` command in the terminal to gather static files into the `staticfiles` directory:
     ```
     python3 manage.py collectstatic
     ```

3. **Deployment:**
   - Check the Python version by running:
     ```
     python3 -V
     ```
   - From the [supported runtimes](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#specifying-a-python-version), copy the runtime closest to the current Python version.
   - Add a `runtime.txt` file to the project's root directory with the copied Python version: `python-3.12.4`.
   - Set `DEBUG` to `False` and push the changes to GitHub.
   - Open the Heroku dashboard, go to the app 'Settings' tab, and under 'Reveal config vars', remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` key/value pair.

### Part 4 - Set Up Deployment from GitHub

1. **Set Up Deployment from GitHub:**
   - In the Heroku dashboard switch to the 'Deploy' tab.
   - Choose 'GitHub' as the deployment method and connect the GitHub account.
   - In the search bar, type the repository name `dog-grooming-salon` and click 'Search' to find it on GitHub.
   - Click 'Connect' to link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

2. **Deploy the App:**
